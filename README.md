# System-Call-Interface---Operating-System-Project
We were tasked with implementing a system call interface primarily to experiment with Memory mangement Calls, File System Calls, Process Management Calls and finally Custom Calls in Linux. This project was made possible by the efforts of my team:
*Sana: Memory mangement Module
*Hasnain: File Management Module
*Fariya: Process Management Module
and I dabbled with the kernel of my Linux to add two custom system calls, one for printing 'Hello World' and one for reversing a string.
